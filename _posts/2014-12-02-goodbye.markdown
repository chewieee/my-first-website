Hello Octopress! I just configured you and got you all worked out, just putting this up as a test. I was originally on a tumblr and didn't visit it much, but was looking for something with a bit more customization. It looks like you could be the answer!

I'll hi-jack my first tumblr post and put it here for a little trip down memory lane, then periodically import the rest of them to octopress so I won't need to go back to tumblr. Sound good? Good! Excited to see what I can do with this thing.

UPDATE: 12-22-14

I'm just all blog confused. I've now opted to go with just jekyll as my blogging platform. It's not as convenient as Octopress, but it allows me to insert the posts cleanly into my static jekyll website. I'm sure there's a way to happily combine the two since one is a framework built on the other so there's probably something I'm not getting. Not probably, most likely. Ha.

There's still work to be done on implementation but I've gotten the site to a presentable state. Phew. Not very UX friendly at all, as the blog has no links to lead you back to the static pages. Easy fix, should be coming soon. To do's also include incorporating some of the plug-ins and learning more markdown to implement syntax highlighting for code and blockquotes for....blockquotes! Pagination, imagination, more creation, static-elation, then...profit!
