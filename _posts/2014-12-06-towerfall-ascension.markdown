I've been putting my PSN+ membership to good use by grabbing all of the monthly free PS4 games offered by the service. The most recent gem to come down the pipeline is called Towerfall Ascension, and I have to say I definitely got more than my money's worth -- see what I did there?

Checking it out on the network, it doesn't look like much. The title screen boasts cool character art but doesn't give the player a particularly clear idea of the cool 8-bit ride they're signing up for. 

There aren't very many instructions either, but in all fairness the game is beautifully simple. As I hopped into the bubble bobble-esque game arrow first, it didn't take long for me to realize I would have to amp up my hand-eye coordination in order to bob and weave through the multiple waves of enemies crawling and flying around the 2D map layout.

The player only has a certain amount of arrows to let loose on the various baddies but thanks to the clever level design, there are many ways to escape tight situations - a la Pac-man - and the arrows are recoverable. Simplicity is the name of the game here, though it becomes increasingly clear with each victory or defeat just how addicting it can be. I found myself promising "ok, this is the last try" for hours on end.

Power ups and arrow increases spice up the game here and there which occassionally help, and a multiplayer option lets you recruit a few friends into the madness. That's where the real fun starts as the competition factor kicks in and players fly around the screen frantically vying for the items in order to gain an edge.

With not much story, or readable text for that matter, the game doesn't look to brag about anything it isn't. Simple and playable, Towerfall Ascension is addictively good fun - no more, no less.
